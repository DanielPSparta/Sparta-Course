Cloud Computing Introduction

On demand delivery of computing resources
Not only servers or computers but also storage, networking, software, data base, processing.
Three categories:
Application
Platform
Infrastructure

You can lease all these resources from providers on the cloud.
BENEFITS
-	Flexibility, the ability to scale up and down in storage, processing power
-	Efficiency – scaling up and down manually is not efficient, it is better to outsource it to the cloud, i.e having to buy new servers and set them up. In the cloud it is done for you.
-	Cost – lower cost due to being able to scale up and down as needed, expect a bump get more, don’t need as many rent less
Concerns
-	Security – large threat surface, many vulnerabilities
-	Data portability -
-	Cloud provider Transparency

Three types of cloud
Private/internal cloud – have your own cloud in the enterprise
Public/external cloud – owned and operated by a third party
Hybrid cloud – Mix of private and public cloud for different functionalities

On-premise, if you have your own hardware and services you are responsible for doing everything
IaaS (Infrastructure as a service), use the resources from a cloud provider, the servers, storage, network, virtualisation
PaaS (platform as a service), You lease the platform itself, not just the infrastructure, you are leasing the server with a platform already installed. Hosting an app without dealing with the OS
SaaS (Software as a service), you lease everything, just like teams, gmail, office 365, vpn etc.

Virtualisation and cloud computing differences:
-	Two different things
-	The concept of the virtualisation forms a base for cloud computing
-	Virtualisation helps in delivery of shared computing resources, data or software
