Cyber security essentials
Introduction
NIST (national institute for standards of technology): The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks
CNSS(committee on national security systems):
1.	Prevention of damage to and
2.	The protection of and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communication services, etc
3.	Including information contained therein
4.	To ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation

3 dimensions
Ensure these three goals is the desired targets of any system
Data state is to ensure that the data is protected in all its states , transmission, storage and processing
Safeguards, to do this use: technology, safeguards and practices and human error

!st dimension Desired goals:
The CIA triad
-	Confidentiality (No unauthorised access to the data)
-	Integrity ( The data should not be tampered/modified in an unauthorised way, ensure data has not be intentionally or unintentionally modified in a way that it is untrustworthy/ messes with its reliability)
-	Availability (everyone who needs access or authorised people are able to have timely and reliable access to the data)

Alice sends a message to bob
Trudy intercepts the message this is loss of confidentiality
If Trudy modifies and sends it, it ruins the integrity
Is Trudy keeps it then it is loss of availability since bob has no access to the data

2nd dimension – data states
1.	Storage (data is stored somewhere) this is DAR (data at rest)
2.	Data in transit, moving data between systems (DIT) data in transit
3.	Processing, performing operations on the data for a desired onjective , secure the data while it is being processed
3rd safeguards
1.	Policy and practices: administrative control, also referred to as operations (how people should act around data and systems)(i.e how to properly configure the firewall)
2.	Human factors, also referred to as personal ( awareness about hoe the personal will manage the data and system, how they apply policy and practices)
3.	Technology: software and hardware-based solutions (Making secure systems)

Essential Terms
1.	Asset: what we are trying to protect (data, users, employees)
2.	Vulnerability:  weakness or a gap in our protection efforts (dev team forgot to
3.	Exploit: The way in which hackers leverage vulnerabilities
4.	Threat: A hypothetical event that has the potential to cause some damage(what we are trying to protect against)
5.	Risk: intersection of assets, threats(what trying to protect against), and vulnerabilities(weakness in protection efforts)

Causes of Vulnerabilities
1.	Design and development errors
2.	Poor system configuration
3.	Human errors (human factor)
4.	Connectivity ( open wifi networks)
5.	Complexity ( the more complex the system the vulnerable the system)
6.	Passwords
7.	User input( check user input to make sure the data is sanitised into the system, other wise it might inject code)
8.	Management ( not easy to manage cyber security, some enterprises do not have good risk assessment or proper training leads to all the above vulnerabilities)
9.	Lack of staff training
10.	Communication

Cyber Attack
2 mains types of attack
1.	Un-targeted cyber attacks
2.	Targeted cyber attacks



National disaster is a cyber threat actor
Or a human error, i.e didn’t mean to do anything, an employee that didn’t set of the vpn properly.







Cyber threats
-	Malware: software that does malicious tasks on a device or network
-	Spyware: is a form of malware that hides on a device providing real-time information
-	Phishing attacks : is when a cybercriminal attempts to lure individuals into providing sensitive data
-	Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: aim to disrupt a computer network by flooding the network with superfluous requests
-	Ransomware: is a type of malware that denies access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid.
-	Zero-day exploit: Is a flaw in the software which was unknown to the party, enterprise or destination which has not been patched> ( a new vulnerability)
-	Advanced persistent threats: is when unauthorised users had access to the system or the networks and remain there without being detected for an extended period of time
-	Trojan: a backdoor in your system to gain access (i.e allow access from a specific ip address)
-	Wiper attacks: is a form of malware whose intention is to wipe the hard drive.
-	Intellectual property theft: is stealing or using someone ip without permission
-	Theft of money: gaining access to credit card numbers or bank accounts to steal money
-	Data manipulation: doesn’t steal data but aims to change the data
-	Data destruction: is when a cyber attacker attempts to delete data
-	Man in the Middle attack: When an attacker relays or alters information between 2 parties to either view the info or changing it.
-	Drive-by downloads: is a download that happens without a person’s knowledge
-	Malvertising: is the use of online advertising to spread malware
-	Rogue software: Rogue software is malware that is disguised as real software
-	Unpatched software: unpatched software is software that has known security weakness that has been fixed in later release but not yet updated
-	Data centre disrupted by natural disaster: the data centre your software is housed on could be disrupted by a natural disaster
-	Water-holing: setting up fake website or compromising a legitimate one in order to exploit visiting users
-	Spear-phishing: sending emails to targeting individuals that could contain an attachment with malicious software, or a link that downloads malicious software
-	Deploying a botnet: to deliver a DDoS attack
-	Subverting a supply chain: to attack equipment or software being delivered to the organisation









Cyber threat Surface
-	All the available end points that a threat actor may attempt to exploit in Internet-connected devices within the cyber threat environment
-	The many processes that produce, deliver and rely on information systems connected to the internet are also potential threat vectors and targets
-	Services, devices and data can all be targeted
-	Systems that connect physical entities with the internet
Cyber kill chain:
The different stages of an attack


1.	Reconnaissance – Getting information on the target, as much as you can get
2.	Weaponization – Getting all the tools to exploit the vulnerabilities found
3.	Delivery – Getting you weapons into the system (i.e using a memory stick to connect to a system)
4.	Exploitation – The tool/weapon is in work currently such as spyware in getting into the system
5.	Installation – Installing the malware on the system so you are trying to get a foothold in the system, try and get permanent access to the system
6.	Command and Control(c2) – getting remote access to the system and being able to control it (trying to use the code that you installed from your system)
7.	Actions on objectives – mission is accomplished,
8.	Retreat – When the mission is finished, you have to destroy the evidence of your existence in the network


Main Computer Components:
Hardware, firmware, software and human ware

The more features you add the wider cyber threat surface you have
Server is just a computer that provides a service

Virtual box is a vm ware can load in instances on it.
