# Week 1 Agile methods

What is agile?
In software development, agile is a set of practices intended to improve the effectiveness of software development professionals, teams, and organizations. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to changes in requirements, resource availability, and understanding of the problems to be solved.[3][4]
There is no single flavour it encompasses :

TDD

Agile is the mindset inspired by the agile manifesto
Came about in the 80-90’s due to lots of failed projects:
-	Too much analysis before project began
-	Restrictive change control ( changing things are not easy due to trying to analyse everything)
-	Too much uncertainty (client might want to change midway through project
-	With larger projects some of the smaller parts become unpredictable
-	Ended up with problems you cannot solve when project was finished

Agile values (NEED TO REMEMBER THESE)
Agile came from experiments of trying to find other ways to approach the projects. From this you get 4 agile values:
-	Individuals & interactions over processes & tools (interactions between team members are more important than tool used to do it)
-	Working software over comprehensive documentation (working software is superior to documentation)
-	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (contracts place to many shackles on developers and customers, contracts allow for change in client requirements)
-	Responding to change over following a plan ( work to the plan until there is a change in the project, the team can then change the plan to fit new circumstances)
Cyber security be as flexible as possible. Security today does not mean security tomorrow.
Daily meeting in the morning of what a team member is doing for that day and what they have done in the previous day.

The agile values are backed by the 12 agile principles (DON’T NEED TO REMEMBER THESE )
1.	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2.	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile process harnesses changes for the customers competitive advantage
3.	Deliver working software frequently, from a couples of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to a smaller time scale
4.	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5.	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them a good environment and support. Trust them to et the job done
6.	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation
7.	Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.	Agile process promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9.	Continuous attention to technical excellence
10.	Simplicity – the art of maximising the amount of work not done – is essential ( divide the big task into smaller task and so on then complete all the smaller tasks )
11.	The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams
12.	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more productive, then tunes and adjusts it’s behaviour accordingly
